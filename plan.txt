Roadmap/TODO
X1. make LED controller truly dynamic, so everything isn't strip1, strip2
X2. implement grouping(treating LEDs on the same strip as 1 LED) in pc GUI, with a saveable config for the groups, also implement set GROUP COLOR, so I guess we would send a strip along with an an array of arrays where the nested arrays are the num pixels in strip
X3. cleanup the double test command when connecting
4. implement effects, which can but run on entire strips(all LEDs) or groups
5. create more effects(each effect file can be run on entire strip or a grouping)
X6. UI for config creation/editing
7. get rid of dan inside of files




1. integrate battery indicator
2. efficencies(figure out rgb 565 or 666, etc)
